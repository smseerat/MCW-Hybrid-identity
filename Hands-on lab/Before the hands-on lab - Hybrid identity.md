# Hybrid identity before the hands-on lab setup guide

## Requirements

-   A Microsoft Azure subscription with at least 16 vCPUs available in the Azure region where the Azure VMs deployed in this lab will reside.

    -   DC1 and APP1 VMs -- 2 x D8s\_v3: 2 x 8 vCPUs = 16 vCPUs

-   A Microsoft account with the owner or the contributor role in the Azure subscription

   > **Note**: The lab computer does not require locally installed software. 

## Before the hands-on lab

Timeframe: 150 minutes


### Task 1: Review the relevant Microsoft documentation 

1. Review online documentation regarding Azure Active Directory at <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/> focusing on its integration with Active Directory and its B2B capabilities.


### Task 2: Validate the role in the Azure subscription

1. Login to the Azure portal at <http://portal.azure.com>, select  **All services**. Then search for and select **Subscriptions**.

     ![In this screenshot, the Azure portal is depicted with 'sub' typed into the search bar and 'subscriptions' highlighted in the results.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-HybridIdentityImages/media/SelectSubscriptions.png "Search for and select Subscriptions in the Azure portal")

2. On the **Subscriptions** blade, select the name of the subscription you intend to use for this lab.

3. On the subscription blade, select **Access control (IAM)**.

4. Review the list of user accounts, and verify that your user account has the Owner or Contributor role assigned to it.


### Task 3: Deploy the lab environment Azure VMs

1. In the browser window displaying the Azure portal, navigate to: <https://github.com/maxskunkworks/TLG/tree/master/tlg-base-config_3-vm>.

2. On the **TLG (Test Lab Guide) - 3 VM Base Configuration (v1.0)** page, select **Deploy to Azure**.

   > **Note**: The 3 VM Base Configuration provisions a Windows Server 2016 Active Directory domain controller named DC1 using the domain name you specify, and a domain member server named APP1 running Windows Server 2016. It also offers an option to provision a client VM running Windows 10, however we will not be using it in our lab (primarily due to licensing requirements applicable when running Windows 10 VMs in Azure). The domain member server (APP1) has automatically installed .NET 4.5 and IIS.

3. On the **Custom deployment** blade, specify the following settings, then select **Review + Create** then **Create**.

    -   Subscription: The name of the target Azure subscription where you want to provision the lab environment Azure VMs.

    -   Resource group: (Create new) **hybrididentity-RG**

    -   Location: The name of the Azure region that will host the lab environment Azure VMs.

    -   Config Name: **TlgBaseConfig-01**

    -   Domain Name: **corp.contoso.com**

    -   Server OS: **2016-Datacenter**

    -   Admin Username: **demouser**

    -   Admin Password: **demo@pass123**

    -   Deploy Client VM: **No**

    -   Client VHD URI: **leave blank**

    -   VM Size: **Standard_D2s_v3**
   
    **Note**: Use a similar VM size if your subscription does not support the listed size. Documentation is linked here: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/sizes>.

    -   DNS Label Prefix: **Any valid, globally unique DNS name (a unique string consisting of letters, digits, and hyphens, starting with a letter and up to 47 characters long).**

    -   _artifacts Location: **Accept the default**

    -   _artifacts Location Sas Token: **leave blank**

    ![In this screenshot, the 'Custom deployment' blade of the Azure portal is depicted with each parameter value field highlighted and each value set to the values stated above.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-HybridIdentityImages/media/BHOL-feb2022-update.png "The custom deployment blade with all the information listed above entered")


4. Select **Review + Create**.

5. After validation has passed, select **Create**.

    ![In this screenshot, the configuration for the deployment that you did on the previous tile is summarized and validated.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-HybridIdentityImages/media/BHOL-feb2022-create-add.png "The custom deployment summarize and create tile")


6. Wait for the deployment to complete. This might take about 60 minutes.

    ![In this screenshot, the deployment is complete and you can go directly to the resource group using the go to resource group button.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-HybridIdentityImages/media/BHOL-feb2022-deployment-complete.png "The custom deployment blade with all the information listed above entered")
